Visual Search Task

Visual search is about how we search and find objects using our vision. Research on searching for items in a search display goes back to the work of Anne Treisman in the late 1970s. One of the important ideas of searching for features with specific items (e.g., searching for a green round bottle among a large collection of bottles) is that this cannot be done in parallel; hence, the more items there are to search through, the longer it takes.

Searching for specific combinations of features in items (e.g., the ROUND GREEN bottle amongst bottles of all sorts of colors and shapes) is known as conjunctive search. The increase in conjunctive search time due to the numbers present is known as the search slope.
